 <summary>How to Add a Block</summary>

<p>You can add a block anywhere you see the + button (called the **Block Inserter**).
This will appear in several places:</p>

<ol>
<li>Click the + Block Inserter at the top left corner of the editor.</li>
<li>On a new line (created by pressing Enter/Return on your keyboard), click the
+ Block Inserter at the side of an empty block.</li>
<li>In the toolbar that appears for a block you have clicked on, select the ...
(three dots) and choose Add before or Add after to insert a new block above or
below the current block.</li>
<li>Once you are familiar with the names of different blocks, you can quickly add
a block by typing a forward slash followed by the block name. For example:
/image or /heading.</li>
</ol>

</details>

<details>
 <summary>Add a Block in a Specific Position</summary>

<p>If you already have content on your page and would like to add new blocks at a
specific place in that content, you can do it in one of two ways:</p>

<p><b>Option 1: Use List View</b></p>

<p>List View is an essential tool when working on your site’s content. To access
List View and add new blocks, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click the three horizontal lines icon in the top left corner of the editor to
open List View.</li>
<li>Click on the existing block you want to add the new block next to.</li>
<li>Click the three dots on the right side of the now-highlighted block.</li>
<li>Choose Add before or Add after.</li>
<li>Click on the + Block Inserter.</li>
<li>Search for the block you’d like to add and click it to insert it in that spot.</li>
</ol>
<br />
<p><b>Option 2: Use the Cursor</b></p>

<p>Using your computer’s mouse/touchpad, you can also add new blocks in certain
spots by following these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Point your cursor to the spot on the page where you want to add a new block,
and hover in that spot.</li>
<li>Click on the + Block Inserter that appears in about a second.</li>
<li>Search for the block you’d like to add and click it to insert it in that spot.</li>
</ol>
</details>

 <summary>Exploring Blocks</summary>

<p>There’s a block for every possible element you might want to add to your site.
To browse the full list of blocks, click the <b>+ Block Inserter</b> in the upper
left corner of the editor. View a full list of blocks and their guides here.</p>

<p>Here, you will see all the blocks divided into categories. When you hover over
a block, it will show you a preview with more information.</p>

<p>Here is also where you can access block patterns (groups of blocks in useful designs).</p>
</details>

<details>
 <summary>See Your Most Used Blocks</summary>

<p>If you find yourself adding the same few blocks all the time, you can surface
your most-used blocks at the top of the list of blocks using the following steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>PClick the ellipses icon (the three dots) at the top right corner of the
editor screen.</li>
<li>Choose <i>Preferences → Blocks</i>.</li>
<li>Toggle on <i>Show most used blocks</i>.</li>
</ol>
</details>

<details>
 <summary>How to Customize Blocks</summary>

<p>The first step is to select the block you want to customize. Select a block
by clicking on the block or using List View to find a specific block.</p>

<p>You can then access the block’s customization options in two places: the block
toolbar and the block settings</p>

</details>

<details>
 <summary>Block Toolbar</summary>

<p>When you click on a block, the block’s toolbar will appear above or below it.
The toolbar contains essential options for working with that block</p>
</details>

<details>
 <summary>Block Settings</summary>

<p>The Block Settings sidebar contains more customization options for the block
you’re working on. Each block has its own settings that you can find in the
settings sidebar</p>

<p>If you don’t see the sidebar, click the settings icon next to Publish / Update
/ Save button in the top right corner of the editor. This icon looks like a square
with two uneven columns:</p>
<p>Many blocks contain settings for color, typography, dimensions, and advanced.
Each block also has a guide you can view to learn more about each block-specific
setting.</p>
</details>

<details>
 <summary>Remove a Block</summary>

<p><b>Select the Right Block</b></p>
<p>Before deleting a block, it’s important to make sure you have selected the
correct block. While you can select most blocks by clicking on them once, some
blocks are inside of other blocks.</p>

<p>One method to select the correct block is using List View. Click on the icon
that looks like three horizontal lines above each other at the top left corner
of your screen:</p>

<p>Three offset stacked vertical lines, to represent the List View.</p>
<p>This will show you a list of all the blocks you have inserted into that
page or post so that you can select a block you wish to remove.</p>

<p>In the image on the right, we can see several blocks inside a single column,
which is then inside a Columns block. So, if we wanted to remove both columns
and all content inside them, we remove the parent Columns block containing
everything else.</p>

<p><b>Delete a Block</b></p>

<p>To remove a block, click on the block, and a toolbar will appear immediately
above or below. Click on the ... (three dots) in the toolbar and select Delete</p>
</details>

<details>
 <summary>Block Patterns</summary>

<p>Block patterns are beautifully designed, ready-to-go layouts you can add in
just a few clicks. </p>
<p>To take a look at the block patterns available, follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Visit your dashboard.</li>
<li>Go to Pages or Posts and click any page or post to edit it, or visit the site
editor at Appearance → Editor.</li>
<li>In the editing screen, click the + Block Inserter in the top left corner.</li>
<li>Click on the Patterns tab.</li>
<li>Browse through the patterns. You can click to view collections of patterns
within a specific category like Text, Image Gallery, Header, Forms, and many more.</li>
<li>Click on any pattern once, and it will be added to your page at the location
of your cursor.</li>
</ol>
</details>

<details>
 <summary>Use Page Layouts</summary>

<p>Page Layouts are pre-designed pages with placeholder content that you can
replace with your own text or images. They are made using blocks in the Block
editor, so you can edit the existing content or add more blocks to a layout.</p>
<p><b>View Page Layouts</b></p>
<p>To view the collection of page layouts you can use on your site, follow these
steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>From your dashboard, click on Pages.</li>
<li>Click on Add new page.</li>
<li>A window will appear for you to browse through the different Page Layout
categories.</li>
<li>Once you find a layout that you like, click it once to apply it to your new page.</li>
</ol>

<p><b>Edit a Page Layout</b></p>
<p>Once you’ve selected a Page Layout, you can replace the placeholder content
with your own content.</p>

<p>Click on any text to edit it. Click on any Image block and click Replace to
swap the image for your own.</p>
