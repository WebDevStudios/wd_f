# Theme Documentation

## Getting started

Meet `wd_f` or `funderscores`: a WordPress block theme. This theme is powered by
the Gutenberg block editor.

Your pages, posts, page templates, and even the header and footer are all
constructed using blocks and block patterns. This theme offers a selection of
block patterns and custom blocks that harmonize with WordPress's core blocks,
enabling you to build your site with creativity.

To quickly familiarize yourself with the block editor, check out the [Gutenberg Demo](https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/).
